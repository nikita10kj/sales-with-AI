      <h4 class="mt-4 text-secondary">6. Data Storage and Security</h4>
      <p>We store user data securely using Microsoft Azure services. All user-related data, including names, email addresses, and generated sales content, is stored in a managed PostgreSQL database hosted on Azure. </p>
      <p>We take data protection seriously and implement the following security measures:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Data is encrypted in transit using HTTPS and encrypted at rest using Azure-managed encryption. </li>
        <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Database and application access is restricted using role-based access controls (RBAC) and secure authentication protocols.</li>
        <li><strong>Backups & Reliability:</strong> Regular automated backups are maintained to ensure data availability and recovery in case of unexpected issues. </li>
        <li><strong>Infrastructure Security:</strong> Azure provides built-in security and compliance features that help protect data from unauthorized access, data loss, or malicious activity. </li>
        
      </ul>
      <p>We do not store users’ Google/Microsoft account credentials. OAuth access tokens are stored securely and used strictly for the intended scope (e.g., sending emails), and can be revoked at any time by the user. </p>
